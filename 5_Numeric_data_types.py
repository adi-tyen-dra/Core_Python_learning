#built in data types in python include numeric, iterator, sequence(also iterator), mapping, file, class and exception.
#python has no type declaration.
#python-2 had 4 but python3 has only 3 data types namely int, float and complex where int was made suffecient to replace the earlier int and long data types of python-2.

#int data type is meant for integer, real num with no fractional part
#float data type is meant for decimals, real num with some fractional part
#this distinction was made between the categories because int computations aee performed significantly faster by computers in comprasion to float computation.
#in python2 int has a limit of (2^31 -1); where as python 3 doesnt have limit for int.
#in python the smallest and largest possibility for float no. is 2.22e-307 and 1.78e+308 with 52 digits of precision available.
