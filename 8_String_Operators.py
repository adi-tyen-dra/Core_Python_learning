# python 3 has 5 sequence types-
# strings, lists, turple, range, bytes & bytearray
# sequence is defined to be the ordered set of items
# eg- string- 
str1 ="hello World!" # is a collection of 12 items each of which are chars.
# list-  
lis1 = [ "computer", "monitor","keyboard","mouse"] # is a collection of 4 items each of which is a string
#sequence are ordered hence we can use indexing to access the individual elements of the sequence as follows-
print(lis1[1][::3]) #will produce "mir" as 1 of lis1 = monitor then [::3] of monitor string gives "mir"

# conclusion: the operators discussed will be applicable to all of the sequence types
