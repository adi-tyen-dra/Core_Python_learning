#A for loop works by iterating over some set of values. 
#It assigns each of the values, one by one, to one or more variables. 
#It then executes a block of code once for each value.
#The set of values comes from a sequence or some other iterable object.
#iterable obj is anything than can be iterated over; sequence is also an iterable
parrot = "Norweigen Blue" #sequence string

for character in parrot:   #for loop
    print(character)
